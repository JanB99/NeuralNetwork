# NeuralNetwork

A simple Neural Network library I wrote in vanilla Javascript. Currently the library only supports the MeanSquaredError loss and the Sigmoid activation function. Attached is a Matrix library with a lot of useful functions. 

Before I study Machine learning with sophisticated frameworks like Tensorflow, I wanted to build a simple Neural Network from scratch.
Materials come from 3Blue1Brown and the Coding Train videos on Neural Networks.
