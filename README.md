# NeuralNetwork

A simple Neural Network library I wrote in vanilla Javascript. Currently the library only supports the MeanSquaredError loss and the Sigmoid activation function. Attached is a Matrix maths library I wrote with all the appropriate functions needed for the Neural Network library. 

Before I start studying Machine learning with sophisticated frameworks like Tensorflow, I wanted to build a simple Neural Network from scratch so that I can understand the maths behind it from a low-level.
